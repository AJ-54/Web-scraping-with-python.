This project scraps data from amazon.com and displays the data in the top priority.
The data scraped is from books department (https://www.amazon.com/s/browse/ref=nav_shopall-export_nav_mw_sbd_intl_books?_encoding=UTF8&node=283155) where the user can directly look at the names of top books by typing in the bookname. 
Nextly the user can demand the details of the book of choice and thus it makes very easy for him to quickly know the details of any book.
